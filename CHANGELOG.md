## Upgrade Instructions

### From 1.0.0 to 1.1.0

1. **Backup your settings:**
   ```bash
   cp /var/lib/jellyfin/plugins/JellyfinUpscalerPlugin_1.0.0/config.json ~/upscaler-backup.json
   ```

2. **Stop Jellyfin service:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop jellyfin
   ```

3. **Remove old version:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf /var/lib/jellyfin/plugins/JellyfinUpscalerPlugin_1.0.0/
   ```

4. **Install new version:**
   ```bash
   # Extract new version to plugin directory
   cp -r JellyfinUpscalerPlugin/* /var/lib/jellyfin/plugins/JellyfinUpscalerPlugin_1.1.0/
   ```

5. **Restore settings (optional):**
   ```bash
   cp ~/upscaler-backup.json /var/lib/jellyfin/plugins/JellyfinUpscalerPlugin_1.1.0/config.json
   ```

6. **Start Jellyfin service:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start jellyfin
   ```

7. **Clear browser cache** to ensure new client-side code is loaded

### Configuration Migration

The plugin will automatically migrate settings from version 1.0.0 to 1.1.0. However, you may want to review and adjust the new performance settings:

- **Adaptive Performance**: Enabled by default
- **Performance Monitoring**: Available in advanced settings
- **Hardware-Specific Profiles**: Check recommended settings for your GPU
